    <h1>Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    
    <p><strong>October 30, 2023</strong></p>
    
    <h2>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</h2>
    
    <h3>Section 1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril. Responsible AI use has the potential to help solve urgent challenges while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure. At the same time, irresponsible use could exacerbate societal harms such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation; displace and disempower workers; stifle competition; and pose risks to national security. Harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks. This endeavor demands a society-wide effort that includes government, the private sector, academia, and civil society.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 2. Policy and Principles</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of my Administration to advance and govern the development and use of AI in accordance with eight guiding principles and priorities. Together, these principles form the framework for how the United States will promote responsible American innovation in AI while protecting Americans' rights and safety.</p>
    
    <p><strong>First</strong>, we must ensure that AI is safe and secure. Meeting this goal requires robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized evaluations of AI systems, as well as policies, institutions, and, as appropriate, other mechanisms to test, understand, and mitigate risks from these systems before they are put to use. It also requires addressing AI systems' most pressing security risks, including through rigorous testing, safeguards against misuse, and cybersecurity practices. These efforts should focus particularly on the risks from dual-use foundation models, which include both specialized and general-purpose AI models with widely available model weights or that are accessible through an application programming interface.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Second</strong>, we must promote responsible innovation, competition, and collaboration. The United States has led in AI innovation. Continued leadership requires a commitment to supporting AI innovation, while addressing associated risks. The Federal Government will partner with the private sector and academia to advance responsible AI innovation that allows the United States to continue to lead in this critical area.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Third</strong>, we must support American workers. As AI creates new jobs and industries, all workers need support to adapt to the changing nature of the workplace. The Administration will help workers thrive through good jobs in AI-related fields and other sectors, including by providing education and training opportunities throughout their careers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Fourth</strong>, we must advance equity and civil rights. The Federal Government must ensure that AI is used to advance equity and civil rights, and that AI systems do not undermine or violate civil rights, civil liberties, or privacy. This includes providing protection from algorithmic discrimination and ensuring that AI systems are used to expand opportunity and not to perpetuate discrimination or exacerbate social problems.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Fifth</strong>, we must protect Americans' privacy and civil liberties. Privacy protections must be strengthened, and the Federal Government must ensure that AI systems protect privacy and civil liberties by employing techniques to minimize the collection of data, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring transparency about how data is used.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sixth</strong>, we must manage AI's broader societal and economic impacts. The Federal Government will advance a coordinated approach to managing AI's broader impacts on society, the economy, national security, and foreign policy. This includes addressing risks to critical infrastructure, the labor market, and democratic processes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Seventh</strong>, we must advance responsible AI internationally. The United States will lead efforts to promote the responsible development and deployment of AI internationally, including through bilateral and multilateral engagement.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Eighth</strong>, we must protect the American people from AI-related fraud and deception. The Federal Government will take steps to detect and mitigate AI-generated content that could facilitate fraud or deception, while protecting free speech and other democratic values.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 3. Definitions</h3>
    <p>For purposes of this order: (a) The term "artificial intelligence" or "AI" has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3): a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.</p>
    
    <p>(b) The term "AI model" means a component of an information system that implements AI technology and uses computational, statistical, or machine-learning techniques to produce outputs from a given set of inputs.</p>
    
    <p>(c) The term "dual-use foundation model" means an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of billions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts; and that exhibits, or could be easily modified to exhibit, high levels of performance at tasks that pose a serious risk to security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 4. Ensuring the Safety and Security of AI Technology</h3>
    <p>To ensure AI safety and security, the Federal Government must ensure that AI systems are tested before deployment and that their capabilities, limitations, and impacts are well understood. The following actions shall be taken: (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), shall establish guidelines and best practices for identifying and labeling AI-generated content and authenticating official content.</p>
    
    <p>(b) Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall develop standards for testing the safety and security of AI systems, including by developing red-teaming approaches for generative AI and dual-use foundation models.</p>
    
    <p>(c) Companies developing or demonstrating an intent to develop potential dual-use foundation models shall be required to provide the Federal Government, on an ongoing basis, with information, reports, or records regarding model training, testing, and performance metrics.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 5. Promoting Innovation and Competition</h3>
    <p>The United States must continue to lead in AI innovation. To promote responsible innovation: (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall establish an AI Safety Board to advise on the safe development and deployment of AI systems. (b) Federal agencies shall prioritize federal support for accelerating the development and adoption of privacy-preserving techniques, including those that use cryptographic or statistical methods that preserve privacy.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 6. Supporting Workers</h3>
    <p>AI is changing the nature of work and the workplace. To support workers: (a) The Secretary of Labor shall develop principles and best practices for employers to mitigate AI's potential harms to employees' well-being and to maximize its potential benefits. (b) The Secretary of Education shall develop resources and policies to help educators and administrators prepare students for an AI-enabled workforce.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 7. General Provisions</h3>
    <p>(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
    
    <p>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
    
    <p>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
